# Mathematics - Function checker

This script is designed to take as input a number which represents the number of
ordered pairs in a relation. It then takes in those ordered pairs and outputs
the entire relation. It also outputs to the screen, formatted text representing
the domain and range of the given relation. Additionally, it tells the user
if the given relation represents a function or not.
